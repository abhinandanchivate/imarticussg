1. DISPLAY EMPLOYEE DETAILS ALONG WITH DEPT DETAILS.
EMPLOYEE TBL:
DEPT TBL : 
COMBINELY RETRIEVE THE DATA FROM 2 TABLES. ===> join ==> to retreive the data from min. 2 tables.
we have to write joining conditions : no of tables -1
(joining condition is based on PK and FK relationship).

select * from employee , dept
m : no of rows from employee  : select count(*) from employee : 5
n : no of rows from dept 	select count(*) from dept 5
total rows : M X N  : 25  ===> cartesian product

Syntax : 

select * from tab1 t1 , tab2 t2 , ..... N 
where t1.pk = t2.fk ... N of conditions based on the no of tables.

Ist Form :select * from employee e , department d where e.deptid=d.depthead; == preferred
2nd Form : select * from employee e join department d on e.deptid=d.depthead; == Ansi style SQL


1. empproject client project employee table.

select * from employee e, empproject ep, client c , project p 
where e.empid = ep.empid and c.clientid = ep.clientid and p.projectid=ep.projectid
ep.endyear=2015









Types of Join:
1. simple join/ equi join /inner join (will not consider the null based values from FK column)

2. outer join :  to get the null(PK FK relation based columns) based records during the join work

a. left outer join : it will retrieve all the records from leftside table irrespective of 
null values

select * from deptartment d left outer join employee e on d.depthead = e.empid

b. right outer join :  it will retrieve all the records from right side table irrespective of 
null values


3. natural join : it should consider the condition by itself no need to write the joining condition.

select * from empproject natural join client;
4. cross join

select * from employee , client;
